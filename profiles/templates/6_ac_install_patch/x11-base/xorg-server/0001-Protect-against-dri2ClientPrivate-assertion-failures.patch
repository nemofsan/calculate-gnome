Subject: [PATCH] Protect against dri2ClientPrivate assertion failures
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

If DRI2ScreenInit hasn't been called yet, DRI2Authenticate and
DRI2CreateDrawable2 cause the X server to crash. This has been observed
to happen on multiple modern Linux distros in various conditions,
including QEMU and VMware VMs. Make these functions more robust in order
to prevent the crash.

This patch was originally provided by Bernhard Ãœbelacker and expanded
upon by Mark Wagner.
